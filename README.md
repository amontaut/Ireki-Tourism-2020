# Ireki-Tourism-2020

Word Press project for the tourist office of the fictional city of Ireki (North Pole). In this repo, only the user guide of the website (supposed to be given to the guys working at the tourist office) (in french) and the additionnal CSS file are available. I completed this project on Febuary 7, 2020.
