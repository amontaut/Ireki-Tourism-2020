# Ireki-Tourism-2020

Word Press project for the tourist office of the fictional city of Ireki (North Pole). I completed this project on Febuary 7, 2020.

The main features are :
- front end :
  - custom theme
  - home page with main links to the website + the last news of Ireki
  - navigation bar
  - search bar
  - Ireki's activities page : you can subscribe to each event
  - contact form with reCAPTCHA 
  - SEO plugin
  - sitemap
  - CSS animations
  - responsive (obviously)
- Back end :
  - 3 admin profiles with different rights
  - creating/edition/deleting events and articles made easy
 
In this repo you will only find : 
- the user guide of the website (supposed to be given to the guys working at the tourist office) (in french) 🥖 
- the additionnal CSS file

The website was once hosted and online but isn't anymore 🤡
